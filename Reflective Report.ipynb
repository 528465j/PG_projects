    "1. ALL are knowns for their **simplicity** as they easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient. \n",
    "2. Logistic Regression proves to be very efficient when the dataset has features that are **linearly separable**.\n",
    "3. It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space. This makes it a bit more of an **accurate approach**.\n",
    "4. In a low to moderate-dimensional dataset, like the dataset processed, having a sufficient number of training examples, logistic regression is **less prone to over-fitting**.\n",
    "5. This algorithm allows models to be **updated easily** to reflect new data."
